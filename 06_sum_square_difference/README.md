<h3>Sum square difference</h3>
<h4>Problem 6</h4>
<p>The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,</br>
1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385</br>
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,</br>
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025</br>
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.</br>
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.</p>

<p>v.1.0</p>
<p>Used a simple algorythm to calculate both and find the difference. 0m0.001s.</br>
Ran with 1,000,000,000 natural numbers: 0m0.610s.</br>
10,000,000,000 numbers: 0m5.891s.</p>

<p>v.2.0</p>
<p>Used the same algorythm but with 2 calculations run in parallel using waiting groups.</br>
