<h3>Highly divisible triangular number</h3>
<h4>Problem 12</h4>
<p>The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:</br>
<code>1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...</code>
<p>Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:</p>
<code> 1: 1</code></br>
<code> 3: 1,3</code></br>
<code> 6: 1,2,3,6</code></br>
<code>10: 1,2,5,10</code></br>
<code>15: 1,3,5,15</code></br>
<code>21: 1,3,7,21</code></br>
<code>28: 1,2,4,7,14,28</code>
<p>We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.</p>
<p>What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?</p>
